Beer Suggestion Project by Sandeep Malladi, Shrabya Timsina, and Luis Buenaventura

some main project files are:
    crawler.py
    data_analysis.py
    data_process.py
    views.py 

in django/mysite 
and in django/mysite/beer-suggester

To run the django interface, run the following command in the terminal in the django/mysite path 
    python3 manage.py runserver

files like selenium_automation.py and beer_dict.json were functioning parts of various methods
we attempted but ultimately did not use in the final product due to issues we initially did not forsee.
